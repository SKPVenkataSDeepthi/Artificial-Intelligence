The Interview Pattern is an advanced approach to interacting with AI, designed to generate more tailored and useful responses by combining it with the Persona Pattern. This method emphasizes personalization by prompting the AI to ask relevant questions about the userâ€™s specific needs before generating a response. 

# The Problem with Naive Approaches
In earlier methods of prompting, such as the naive approach, the AI typically responds to questions without seeking clarification or context. For example:
If you ask for a gym workout program to lose weight and build strength, the AI might provide a generic program for a typical person.
This response may not account for factors like your fitness level, available equipment, or any injuries, making it less useful or even impractical for your needs.

# The Persona Pattern
The Persona Pattern improves upon the naive approach by asking the AI to "role-play" as an expert in a specific field. For instance, you might instruct the AI to act as a fitness expert, thereby focusing the responses within the domain of fitness and training. However, even with this improvement, the AI might still offer generalized advice.

# The Interview Pattern
The Interview Pattern builds on the Persona Pattern by introducing an interactive and question-driven approach. The AI begins by interviewing the user to gather detailed information before crafting a response. This makes the output more personalized and actionable.
