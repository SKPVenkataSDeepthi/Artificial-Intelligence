    "# Introduction:\n",
    "LangChain is a Python library designed to make it easy for you to work with Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT models, IBM WatsonX, and others. Whether we want to create chatbots, summarizers, or extract information from documents, LangChain provides all the tools we need in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What’s Special About LangChain?\n",
    "* LangChain isn’t just about using language models—it offers flexibility and features to make your tasks simpler and more powerful. \n",
    "1. Seamless Integration: Connects to multiple language models like OpenAI, Cohere, and Hugging Face.\n",
    "2. Document Handling: Extracts information from files like PDFs, emails, PowerPoints, and even HTML pages.\n",
    "3. Chatbots: Helps us to create smart, human-like conversations by combining memory, prompts, and conversational logic.\n",
    "4. Extra Features: Includes tools like Google Search or a calculator, making our chatbot or application smarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Setting up the Workspace\n",
    "Before diving into LangChain, we will need to prepare our computer environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "A virtual environment keeps all our project-related libraries separate from the rest of our computer. This way, everything stays organized, and different projects don’t interfere with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps to Create a Virtual Environment\n",
    "1. pip3 install virtualenv \n",
    "2. virtualenv my_env # create a virtual environment my_env\n",
    "3. source my_env/bin/activate # activate my_env\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then, install the required liberies in the environment:\n",
    "# installing required libraries in my_env\n",
    "pip install langchain==0.1.0 openai==0.28 gradio==4.21.0 chromadb tiktoken\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is Gradio?\n",
    "Gradio is a tool that helps you create simple, user-friendly web apps where people can interact with your machine learning models or AI projects. You don’t need to be an expert in web development to use it—it’s designed to make things super easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Think of Gradio Like This\n",
    "Imagine we’ve built a cool AI project, like a chatbot or an image classifier. How do we let others try it out?\n",
    "Gradio gives us a ready-made interface where users can type messages, upload files, or click buttons to interact with our AI. It works in our browser, so there’s no need to install anything special to use the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What Makes Gradio Great?\n",
    "1. Easy to Use:  only need a few lines of Python code to create a Gradio app.\n",
    "2. Accessible to Anyone: Once the app is ready, we can share a link, and people can open it on their devices—just like visiting a website.\n",
    "3. Interactive: Gradio supports text inputs, images, audio, and more. This makes it perfect for building tools like:\n",
    "Chatbots\n",
    "4. Image-to-text converters\n",
    "5. Audio transcribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Does Gradio Work?\n",
    "1. We will Write the AI Code: create a chatbot with a language model.\n",
    "2. Gradio Adds the Interface: Gradio makes a box where users can type their messages to the chatbot.\n",
    "3. Instant Access: Gradio opens the app in the browser. we can share this link with others, so they can try it too.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Should You Use Gradio?\n",
    "1. No Coding Hassles: we don’t need to build a website from scratch.\n",
    "2. Collaboration Made Easy: Share our AI work with classmates, teammates, or clients with just as a link.\n",
    "3. Supports Creativity: From text generation to drawing tools, Gradio can handle all sorts of projects.\n",
