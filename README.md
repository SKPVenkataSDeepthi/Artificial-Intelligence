Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Repository! This repository serves as a collection of resources, notes, and projects from various AI and machine learning courses I am currently studying. The aim is to document my learning journey, with links to foundational courses, hands-on projects, and open-source AI tools.

I will be continuously updating this repository with relevant files, code, and insights gained from these resources. You can follow along, use them for your own learning.

## Learning Resources

Below are the courses and materials I am currently studying, which will be referenced and incorporated into this repository:

### 1. [Fundamentals of AI](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/fundamentals-of-ai)
