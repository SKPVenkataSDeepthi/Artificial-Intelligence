Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Repository! This repository serves as a collection of resources, notes, and projects from various AI and machine learning courses I am currently studying. The aim is to document my learning journey, with links to foundational courses, hands-on projects, and open-source AI tools.

I will be continuously updating this repository with relevant files, code, and insights gained from these resources. You can follow along, use them for your own learning, or collaborate on related projects.

## Learning Resources

Below are the courses and materials I am currently studying, which will be referenced and incorporated into this repository:

### 1. [Fundamentals of AI](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/fundamentals-of-ai)
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to AI. It covers key concepts such as machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, and the ethical challenges surrounding AI technologies.  
- **Topics covered**:  
  - AI evolution and its impact on industries  
  - Core AI concepts: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks  
  - AI ethics: Privacy, Bias, Accountability  

### 2. [Learn AI Hands-on: Generative AI](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn-ai-hands-on-generative-ai)
Generative AI is a cutting-edge technology that allows machines to create original content such as art, music, and human-like text. This course dives into the creative potential of AI and its impact on industries like entertainment, design, and marketing.  
- **Topics covered**:  
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Models  
  - Creating AI-generated art, music, and text  
  - Ethical implications of Generative AI  

### 3. [Enhancing Applications with Embeddable AI](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/integration-of-embeddable-ai)
This course teaches how to integrate AI technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text-to-Speech, and Speech-to-Text into applications. No advanced programming knowledge is neededâ€”basic coding skills are sufficient to get started with embeddable AI.  
- **Topics covered**:  
  - Using OpenAI and IBM Watson APIs
